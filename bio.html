                    mom
                    immigrated from the Philippines to the U.S. Both my parents believed that my siblings and I could
                    have access to better education, better careers, and simply put, better lives in the US. And now
                    looking back, 21 years later, I can only imagine what it must have been like for my mom to have to
                    build a life and career in a new place without much family or friends. After working multiple
                    back-to-back jobs for six years, my mom and dad found a way to petition for the rest of us to live
                    with her as immigrants in San Francisco. In December 2005, we moved to the Tenderloin, ‚Äúone of the
                    most ethnically diverse and poorest neighborhoods in the city‚Äù on paper, but to me it was and will
                    forever be home.

                    started
                    working longer hours; I only saw them in the morning before school started and around 9 or 10 PM
                    when they got back from work. There wasn‚Äôt much time to catch up about our days or get homework
                    support. I knew they worked as hard as they did for my siblings and I so that we could have food on
                    the table, a roof over our heads and other necessities. I‚Äôm grateful for their sacrifices which
                    influenced me to do my best in my academics and extracurriculars. In the back of my head, I had this
                    expectation that if my parents were working hard, I should too.

                    my
                    roots as a Filipina. It started off with my language. I spoke English in school and brought it home
                    because I wanted to practice talking and sounding American to prevent getting bullied from my thick
                    Tagalog accent. Gradually, people could no longer hear my accent and I started forgetting Tagalog
                    words. As time went on, I also spoke less and less with my family and friends in the Philippines.
                    Our lives were different and I didn‚Äôt know how to sustain our relationships from 8,000+ miles away.
                    Even though I was abroad, I knew that my family and friends from back home will always be family,
                    and that reassured me to focus on my life in the U.S.

                    My local activism opened doors for me to do international work through the World Food Prize. After
                    graduating high school, I travelled to India on an internship to conduct research on how
                    microfinance was used in rural communities. By meeting women in the Self-Help Groups (SHGs), I
                    learned how microfinance elevated their family and community. These SHGs received small loans that
                    women spent on their families and businesses. They held each other accountable and supported one
                    another to repay back the loan in a timely manner. The most eye opening lesson I learned from these
                    women was the sense of empowerment they developed from managing their own finances. In the village I
                    visited, women were expected to be caretakers, cooks, and housewives. They‚Äôre discouraged
                    financially from supporting their families because that was their husband‚Äôs job. Microfinance and
                    the community that SHGs built changed that narrative for them. Being in a new country and <a

                    When I came back from India, I had a week until I started college at UC Berkeley. I was excited to
                    learn and apply what I learned. However, my classes were not what I expected. I came in as an
                    Applied Math major because Calculus was my favorite subject in high school, but my college math
                    classes became my least favorite classes. Ironically, I didn‚Äôt see how the concepts we learned were
                    applicable to my everyday life. I also learn the best when working with people, but it was
                    challenging to find those people in my classes. Most of my classmates in my math classes worked
                    siloed and when I asked them for help, I felt judged by not knowing the answer. I started to feel
                    imposter syndrome and being one of the only Filipina women in my Math classes didn‚Äôt help alleviate
                    those feelings.

                <p class="article__content">
                    By the end of Freshman year, I decided to apply to the Business major. I wanted to learn concepts
                    and material that I can apply towards solving problems I cared about. I was also interested in
                    combining the lessons I learned from both of my parents in their careers as an Entrepreneur and
                    Community Organizer. Although I found lower-division Business courses more applicable than my Math
                    courses, my grades started to slip because of all of my other involvements. Throughout college I
                    worked part-time jobs and internships to pay for my education. I promised my parents that I would
                    pay for all my college expenses. Money was always tight for my parents, and I didn‚Äôt want to burden
                    them with any more financial stress. They also advised against me using loans because they didn‚Äôt
                    want me to get in the habit of borrowing more than I needed. So, I worked 20-30 hours/week to afford
                    my books, rent, groceries, etc.

                <p class="article__content">
                    Working my part-time internships became a necessity, but I also started to enjoy them because of the
                    impact I had. In one of my internships, I worked on a data project with a nonprofit from the
                    Tenderloin. They collected data using pen & paper and Microsoft Excel; their data was not
                    centralized. By the end of my project, I worked with them to centralize their data and translate it
                    to the app they were starting to build. Unlike my classes, my internships allowed me to apply what I
                    learned towards impact. This relevancy was a missing piece from my Berkeley undergrad education.

                <p class="article__content">
                    Not only was I working on a part-time basis, but I also co-founded a student organization called the

                    collaborate on projects that are addressing problems related to poverty, health, environment, and
                    society. I became deeply invested in building ICB because I was frustrated by the lack of relevancy
                    and applicable skills I was not learning from my classes. I channeled my frustration into growing
                    ICB and providing opportunities for students in similar shoes as myself.

                    During the spring of my junior year, I took a break from school to work a full-time internship at
                    Twitter as a Public Policy Fellow. My mentor passed on the job opportunity to me during the fall and
                    I thought it was perfect timing. It was an exciting role because I would work and learn directly
                    from the team that led initiatives to serve the Tenderloin and South of Market communities in San
                    Francisco. At that
                    point, I was also undeclared and I switched majors twice from Applied Mathematics to Business to
                    Cognitive Science. I needed a change of environment especially because my mental health and
                    self-confidence took a toll when I didn‚Äôt get into the Business major. Plus, I was struggling
                    heavily to connect my studies with my passion and interests which started to show in my academic
                    performance.

                    because it made me redefine what higher education meant for me. Before, I believed that receiving a
                    college education meant that we should apply what we learned from our classes right away. For
                    example, my decisions to continue my part-time internships and to lead ICB stemmed from me wanting
                    to use my education to make an impact and applying myself right away. After I finished my
                    internship, I reframed my perspective of higher education from ‚Äúapplying the lessons I learned in
                    college now‚Äù to ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay if we use this skill or information later in life‚Äù. This new perspective
                    led me to feel rejuvenated and ready to finish my senior year on a strong note.

                    Senior year was both intense and rewarding. I took 20+ units each semester and worked a part-time
                    internship at the <a href="https://www.kaporcenter.org/" target="_blank"
                        class="project-inline-link">Kapor Center</a>, an organization with a mission to diversify the
                    tech and
                    entrepreneurship sectors. I stepped down from leadership positions in ICB and other extracurricular
                    activities and focused my time outside the Kapor Center on my academics. My days generally went from
                    9 AM to 12 AM with about two-three hour breaks in total. I treated every day with intense focus. My
                    new sense of appreciation for college, gained from taking a semester-off, motivated me to persevere
                    through my toughest days. Not only did I learn a lot, but I was extremely proud of myself for
                    passing all my classes and securing a full-time job before graduating.

                    A week after graduating, I worked with <a href="https://www.makeschool.com/" target="_blank"
                        class="project-inline-link">Make School</a> as an Executive Assistant/Special Projects. Make
                    School is a college that offers a Bachelor‚Äôs in Applied Computer Science in 2-2.5 years using
                    project-based, industry relevant curriculum all without requiring upfront tuition. I loved how they
                    were redefining what and how a college education was. It was the perfect place for me to thrive in
                    because I would work and learn directly from one of the co-founders and collaborate with all of the
                    teams. I also got the opportunity to work on projects with students, have visibility on our
                    priorities as an executive team, and support various initiatives from accreditation to student
                    growth. On top of that, I developed stronger organization and communication skills which I‚Äôll bring
                    to my future careers.
