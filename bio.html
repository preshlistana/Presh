                <p class="testimonial__text">Precious has been a standout ever since I first met her as a part of an
                    elite high
                    school STEM
                    program called SMASH. I watched her journey through UC Berkeley and into her career, and her passion
                    for bridging the access gap in STEM for underrepresented communities has never wavered. I am
                    fortunate that Precious chose to volunteer as a teaching assistant in my AP Computer Science
                    Principles class. Her mini-lessons and hands-on support to our students is invaluable. She has a
                    bright future as an educator. I cannot wait to volunteer in her classroom someday soon!</p>

                <p class="testimonial__text">Precious had a tremendously positive impact on our school’s culture. In
                    addition to project managing
                    a number of executive projects, she spearheaded community engagement initiatives that deepened our
                    staff and student’s relationship with each other and their city.</p>

                <p class="testimonial__text"> I am confident to say that Precious has a profound way of demonstrating
                    the art of leadership both on
                    an individual basis and to the masses. As a fellow co-founder for the Invention Corps of UC
                    Berkeley, I witnessed Pecious' sense for innovation and determination by creating student-led
                    organization that used design thinking to tackle issues in poverty, society, health, and the
                    environment. For the past 3 years, Precious' consistent ability to inspire others has since brought
                    our initial vision into reality and has since reached communities on the global scale. Upon our
                    simultaneous pursuit of impact within technology, innovation, and education, I know she will
                    continue to use her passion and technical abilities to achieve nothing but excellence.</p>
