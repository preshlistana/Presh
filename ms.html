                        target="_blank">Make School</a> is a college that offers a Bachelor’s in Applied
                    Computer Science in 2-2.5 years with no upfront tuition required. Before joining the team, they
                    hosted and participated in numerous hackathons. The strategy and implementation of this initiative
                    was not properly documented and streamlined when I joined. Given that the high school hackathon
                    community is one of our prime target markets, it was essential for us to have a clear strategy in
                    how we connected and engaged with these students.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description mt-3">
                    I took the time to learn what worked in the past and found that we spent thousands of dollars in
                    hackathon sponsorships for speaking engagements. There also was not a document outlining the
                    strategy and how to implement it. I took these two observations into mind as I lead our hackathon
                    initiatives.

                <h2 class="project-subtitle">Solution</h2>
                <p class="project-description mt-3">One of the biggest contributions I had for this project was
                    streamlining our sponsorship process. Every organizer interested in our sponsorship was required to
                    submit a sponsorship request form. Then, I had a vetting process that looked into the ROI of each
                    hackathon and our team’s bandwidth to support financially and in people-time to do a keynote, lead a
                    workshop and/or table for Make School. If all the variables aligned, I would negotiate the financial
                    sponsorship amount. With all of our venue-sponsored hackathons, I also worked with my student-leads
                    to engage our students to volunteer and mentor the high school hackathon participants. This process
                    led us to spend at an all-time low with a $6,000 budget and support 20+ hackathons which yielded 30
                    application drafts and 8 submitted applications to our college.
