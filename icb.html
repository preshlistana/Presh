                <p class="project-description mt-3">When I was a college sophomore, I was frustrated with how
                    theoretical and impractical my classes were with my interests and passions. This changed when I
                    joined the <a class="project-inline-link" href="https://universityinnovationfellows.org/"
                        target="_blank">University Innovation Fellowship (UIF)</a> with my friends. UIF brought students
                    from all backgrounds that were committed in developing innovation and entrepreneurship in their own
                    Universities using design thinking. My friends and I co-founded the Invention Corps of Berkeley at
                    that time to address the gap in skills and social impact from our collegiate experience.

                <h2 class="project-subtitle">Solution</h2>
                <p class="project-description mt-3">The Invention Corps of Berkeley is a student-led organization that
                    teaches undergrads human-centered design to apply towards impact-driven projects. Our club connects
                    diverse teams with organizations that are addressing problems related to poverty, health, society
                    and the environment. For a semester, our teams collaborate with their mentors to address a challenge
                    framed in a “how might we question”. To-date, we have worked on 33 projects from various industries.
                    You can find examples of <a class="project-inline-link" href="https://inventioncorps.org/#projects"
                        target="_blank">our recent projects here</a>.
                    <p class="project-description mt-3">
                        Outside of the projects, all of our members participate in weekly workshops to learn and develop
                        their skills in design thinking, project management, teamwork, wireframing, prototyping, and
                        etc.
                        These are tangible skills they use on their projects throughout the semester. There are also
                        social
                        events that strengthen our camaraderie and community. Now, our alumni work in roles from
                        Software
                        Engineering to Project Management in many different industries including tech, education,
                        health,
                        biomedical and consulting.
