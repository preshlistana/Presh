                    Science class over the summer
                    when I was in the 10th grade. I dragged and dropped my first-ever line of code in <a
                        href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target=" _blank" class="project-inline-link">Scratch</a>. Our
                    goal
                    was to create any story we wanted to share with the class. I remember the thrill of clicking the
                    green flag ( <img src="assets/scratch_flag.png" class="teaching__scratch" target="_blank"
                        alt="Scratch flag"> ) to run
                    my code as I watched the
                    program run as I had hoped. That summer, I learned to
                    create art using Computer Science.
                </p>
                <p class="article__content">My high school didn‚Äôt offer CS classes so I never heard of them until I
                    became a <a href="https://www.smash.org/" target="_blank" class="project-inline-link">Summer Math &
                        Science Honors (SMASH)</a> scholar. SMASH provided a tuition-free, intensive STEM education to
                    low-income, students of color. For three summers in a row, I lived in the UC Berkeley dorms and
                    learned from majority Black & Brown teachers and classmates. In and out of our classrooms, we
                    discussed our cultural identities, the stereotypes we faced, parental expectations, and our career
                    aspirations. At SMASH, I felt like I could bring my full self to class, free of any negative
                    judgment. I felt liberated not to hide being an immigrant or a low-income student; in fact it was
                    encouraged to dive into those identities.
                </p>
                <p class="article__content">I recognize that having access to CS classes is not the norm for every Black
                    & Brown student nor is
                    having a safe classroom to bring their authentic selves into. SMASH was an opportunity for me to
                    explore both. This empowered me to see myself to succeed in any industry that may not be
                    representative of my lived experiences. My cultural differences and worldviews are part of my
                    superpowers that shape my work. It is not something to hide but rather elevate.

                    This lack of diversity is not news but it is a horrifying trend with negative consequences. A 2019

                    technologies, they are susceptible and vulnerable to be wrongly accused and convicted within the

                    take in are not enough and representative of POCs. Are these data inefficiencies the types of

                    A tech workforce that is majority comprised of white, cis-males is a part of the reason that these
                    product deficiencies exist. Their lived identities are drastically different from Black and Brown
                    people. Racially-speaking, POCs don‚Äôt benefit from white privilege. Gender-speaking, non-binaries
                    and women of color don‚Äôt benefit from male privilege. Because of these differences in experiences, a
                    white, cis-male dominated workforce may not recognize how their technologies and products oppress
                    underrepresented communities.

                    Bringing in a more diverse workforce is part of the solution. The other is retaining them and
                    ensuring that the workplace welcomes their authentic selves. As a ripple effect, these harmful
                    consequences on POC communities may be mitigated.

                    our communities. I became more curious to learn how to apply STEM concepts inside and outside the
                    classroom. It helped feeling valued and empowered to connect my studies with causes that I cared
                    about.

                    It takes personal commitment, training programs, self-reflection and teacher-centered communities to
                    develop effective practices to teach underrepresented students in CS. On a policy-wide level, 38
                    states currently implement statewide CS teacher certification. I specifically enrolled in

                        class="project-inline-link" target=" _blank">Berkeley‚Äôs BE3 teaching program</a> because of
                    their focus on
                    equity and authorization to teach CS. Not all states provide this opportunity for aspiring
                    teachers that want to teach CS. </p>
                <p class="article__content">Before and after BE3, I‚Äôm committed to educating myself on how minority
                    students experience
                    oppression in our schools. I know that reading books on this topic, participating in conversations
                    with other teachers and seeking feedback from my future students are some of the actions I can take
                    to ensure that I cultivate a safe and welcoming space for them. I am also committed to learning new
                    technologies and teaching Computer Science in engaging and relevant ways similar to my SMASH
                    experience. Growing as an educator is a necessity and my responsibility for my students. I‚Äôm
                    grateful that I have the opportunity to dive more into this through BE3.

                    Growing up, I had no mentors in the tech field. I didn‚Äôt know what tech careers were nor how to land
                    them until I became a SMASH scholar. Since I didn‚Äôt have continued exposure to CS outside of my
                    SMASH summers, I didn‚Äôt develop my interest or skills. A 5-week summer class was definitely not
                    enough time for me to have the foundational skills and self-confidence I needed to succeed in my
                    college CS class.

                <p class="article__content">
                    I failed my Intro to CS class in college twice. I was playing catch-up with every new lesson and
                    struggled to apply the concepts I learned into the homework and projects. It got so bad that most of
                    the time I wrote code, my mind thought of how incapable I was in solving the problem. Thoughts like:
                    ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do this‚Äù, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre typing‚Äù, and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too behind to know what to do‚Äù
                    kept looping in my mind. Slowly I believed these stories. I didn‚Äôt realize it then, but this
                    negative self-efficacy is a consequence of my lack of exposure to the subject, role models in the
                    tech field, and the stereotypes I had of who Computer Scientists, programmers, and software
                    engineers were. Frankly, I didn‚Äôt fit the white and male stereotype. I also rarely asked for
                    help
                    because I paralyzed myself into believing that whatever I asked would be a dumb question considering
                    how behind I was. So, I hid my frustrations from others and tried to figure out the challenging
                    concepts on my own.

                <p class="article__content">
                    On my third time taking the course, I had a lot of unlearning to do starting with the negative
                    perceptions I had with my own ability. Whenever I repeatedly thought of myself as incompetent when I
                    coded, I would pause my work and remind myself how much I‚Äôve learned so far. It was an effective
                    practice that reframed my challenge into an opportunity to keep learning. The goal was not to master
                    a new concept, but rather to learn more than I did the previous day. Second, I made friends and
                    mentors to code with and provide me with constructive feedback. I found comfort working with POC
                    beginner-coders and seeking advice from my older brother. I had a small community to lean on
                    whenever I was stuck and ask questions, free of judgement. Talking out my conceptual frustrations
                    with my older brother, who‚Äôs a software engineer, reassured me that learning takes time. For him,
                    studying Computer Science was a consistent journey of discovery and it‚Äôs okay if it doesn‚Äôt click
                    right away. He encouraged being kind to myself, to take breaks, and to stay persistent as other
                    important tools to learn CS. His advice and belief in my abilities inspired me to be kind to myself
                    and to have fun with learning. Unlearning the negative perceptions I had in my ability to succeed in
                    CS took time. Creating a community and finding mentors that I trusted was key to that process.

                    One of my goals is to be the type of teacher that mentors their students to use their education to
                    develop their curiosities and apply them towards social impact. When I was in high school, I found
                    mentors that did just that. My lifelong mentor from the Tenderloin Boys & Girls Club shared
                    opportunities from scholarships to part-time jobs, wrote me numerous Letter of Recs, and revised
                    many of my applications. He and many others helped me believe in myself and saw my potential to
                    succeed despite the barriers I‚Äôve experienced in life. I‚Äôm striving to be that type of teacher for
                    my future students.

                    Through my class, I hope that my students can see themselves belonging and succeeding in any career,
                    especially a technical career. I plan to teach them the tech industry‚Äôs diversity gap and the
                    barriers that persist in landing and retaining a technical career. That way, they know what to
                    expect and that their stories and experiences are part of the puzzle in solving this problem. My
                    hope is that our class will empower them to use CS as a problem-solving tool and leverage their
                    lived experiences as their super powers in guiding them to create more inclusive products and
                    opportunities for others.
